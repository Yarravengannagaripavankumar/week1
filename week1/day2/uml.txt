Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams:-
       UML is a standard visual modeling language used to represent the structure and behavior of a software system. It helps in designing, analyzing, and communicating system architecture before coding.

UML diagrams are classified into behavioral and structural diagrams. Behavioral diagrams represent the dynamic behavior of the system, while structural diagrams represent the static structure of the system.

There are 7 types of structural UML diagrams: Class, Object, Component, Deployment, Package, Composite Structure, and Profile diagrams.

Class Diagram:-
           A class diagram is the most widely used UML diagram that represents the static structure of a system by showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships between them.
Object Diagram:-
            An object diagram represents instances of classes and their relationships at a particular point in time. It can be considered a snapshot of the system during execution and is similar to a class diagram but with real object values.
Component Diagram:-
              A component diagram is a structural UML diagram that represents the physical components of a software system and their dependencies, helping to understand the system’s implementation and architecture.
Component Diagram = Big software blocks + interfaces

Deployment Diagram:-
              A deployment diagram is a UML structural diagram that represents the physical architecture of a system by showing hardware nodes and the software artifacts deployed on them.
Deployment Diagram = Software + Hardware mapping

Package Diagram:-
            A package diagram is a structural UML diagram used to represent the organization of packages and the dependencies between them, helping to group related elements and simplify system design.

Composite Structure Diagram:-
            A composite structure diagram is a UML structural diagram that represents the internal structure of a class or component using parts, ports, and connectors to show how it behaves and interacts internally.

Profile Diagram:-
            A Profile Diagram is a UML structural diagram used to extend and customize UML for specific domains by using stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints.


Behavioral UML Diagrams:-
            Behavioral UML diagrams represent the dynamic aspects of a system by showing how objects interact and how the system behaves over time in response to events.

Behavioral UML = System behavior + interaction + flow

Behavioral UML diagrams include Use Case, Activity, Sequence, State Machine, Communication, Interaction Overview, and Timing diagrams.

Use Case Diagrams:-
         A Use Case Diagram represents the functional requirements of a system by showing interactions between external actors and the system. It provides a high-level view of what the system does without implementation details.

Use Case Diagram = User + Actions + System

Activity Diagrams:-
         An activity diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that represents the flow of control and sequence of activities in a system, including decisions and parallel processes.
Activity Diagram = Flowchart of system behavior

Sequence Diagram:-
        A sequence diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that represents interactions between objects in a system in the order in which they occur over time.
Sequence Diagram = Conversation between objects (top → bottom)

State Machine Diagrams:-
        A state machine diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that represents the dynamic behavior of a system or class by showing its states and transitions in response to events and external stimuli
  State Machine Diagram = States + Events + Transitions

Communication Diagram:-
         A communication diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that represents interactions between objects by showing sequenced messages and the relationships among objects in a free-form layout.
Communication Diagram = Objects + Links + Numbered messages

Interaction Overview Diagram:-
          An Interaction Overview Diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that provides a high-level view of control flow between interactions, combining features of activity and interaction diagrams to model complex system behavior.

Timing Diagram:-
        A timing diagram is a behavioral UML diagram that represents the behavior of objects over a specific time period, focusing on state changes and time constraints.
